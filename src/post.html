“Think [about blockchain] as a peer-to-peer distributed network that doesn’t have to push transactions through any central authority in order to get them done,” Maki explained.
“It’s difficult for all of these [health care] stakeholders to interact with a patient at the center on their behalf and to exchange data efficiently. What you’re describing [in health care] is a distributed network.”

The discussion at this <a href="/foo">Under the Boughs</a> is part of the national conversation about placing people at the center of care delivery. Special attention will be paid to open health data and APIs. Questions discussed will include: How can open health data fuel new care models? What are the associated policy and technical levers we can pull to simplify data ingestion, preparation, and use by the care team? How does the movement toward open data mesh with the other forces driving change in health care delivery and financing?

    <li>Level of commitment and engagement</li>
    <li>Quality of contributions</li>

Social media makes us all, to some extent or another, public figures. But what was clear is that the demands made of media personalities, presidents of health plans, and of chief executives of professional associations differ greatly. That all three panelists are so effective at engaging their audiences via social media reinforced the belief for this audience member that there are as many successful strategies for leveraging social media as there are executives that want to engage in those spaces.
